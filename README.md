Ruby Block Converter for Sublime Text 2
==============================
A command plugin that enables to toggle ruby blocks between braces and `do end`.

How It Works
--------------
Place the cursor in the block and run the command:

```ruby
# original
foo { bar }

# run "brace_to_do_end"
foo do
  bar
end

# run "do_end_to_brace"
foo { bar }
```

do_end_to_brace shrinks a block in a line when the block traverses at most 3 lines.

```ruby
# original
foo {|a|
  a.bar
}

# run "brace_to_do_end"
foo do |a|
  a.bar
end

# but when revert with "do_end_to_brace",
foo {|a| a.bar }
```

When a block has more than 3 lines, do_end_to_brace leaves those lines untouched.

```ruby
# original
foo do
  bar
  baz
end

# run "do_end_to_brace"
foo {
  bar
  baz
}
```

Install
-------
Use [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) and search for "Ruby Block Converter."

Key Binding
-----------
By default,
`ctrl+shift+[` do_end_to_brace
`ctrl+shift+]` brace_to_do_end

Compatibility
-------------
- Mac: Sublime Text 3 ready!
- Linux: Sublime Text 3 ready!
- Other: Not tested

Future
------
I have a plan to conbine these two commands. That should behave like TextMate.
